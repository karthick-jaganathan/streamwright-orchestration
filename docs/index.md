# streamwright.orchestration — running the streamwright CLI as Dagster pipelines

Named declarative DAGs (**pipelines**) run the `streamwright` CLI per **user** and **network**, as Dagster op graphs.

- **Network-agnostic:** Google Ads is just one entry in `config/networks.yaml`.
- **Never imports streamwright:** every node shells out to the streamwright CLI (`$STREAMWRIGHT_BIN`, default
  `/tmp/streamwright-sdk-venv/bin/streamwright`).
- **Package:** `streamwright.orchestration` (distribution `streamwright-orchestration`), this repository.
- **Status:** a **prototype**.

> **Prototype stubs:** `config/networks.yaml` (the network registry) and `src/streamwright/orchestration/accounts.py` (the
> account + secrets providers) are stand-ins; in production both come from a database / registry service (API).

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | the pipeline/network model, the shared vocabulary, wrappers, op graphs and the trigger, the execution-mode mechanics and how secrets flow |
| [Running](running.md) | installing and testing the package, triggering pipelines, seeing CLI runs in the Dagster UI, the execution modes (`subprocess`, `docker`, `k8s`) and the environment variables |

For how orchestration fits the whole StreamWright system (with sequence diagrams), see the
[Architecture guide](https://streamwright.web.app/docs/architecture/). Every node runs [streamwright](https://streamwright.web.app/docs/)'s
`streamwright run`.

## In one minute

- **Pipelines** (`config/pipelines/<name>.yaml`) — a named DAG of **canonical** node names and their `after` edges.
- **Networks** (`config/networks.yaml`) — map each network to a StreamWright source, with:
  - its `inputs`, `connectors` and container `image`;
  - a `streams:` map (the [*shared vocabulary*](architecture.md#shared-vocabulary-one-pipeline-across-networks-that-name-streams-differently)):
    alias or `false`-skip each canonical node.

  So one pipeline runs across many networks that name (or lack) streams differently.
- **Accounts & secrets** (`accounts.py`) — the account provider (the `(user, account, network)` rows a trigger fans
  out over, each carrying its own `token`) and the secrets provider (per-network app credentials, by region).
- **Wrappers** — turn a node into its `streamwright run` command, derived from the source's declared `spec`.
- **Execution** — each node runs as a local subprocess (default), a `docker run`, or a Kubernetes Job
  (`STREAMWRIGHT_EXECUTION`; see [Execution modes](running.md#execution-modes)).

- Each `(pipeline, network)` is its own Dagster job `ads_<pipeline>__<network>`.
- `trigger(pipeline, user)` runs it for each of the user's accounts.

See [Architecture](architecture.md) for the full model.

## Security in short

Secrets never travel as data.

- They are resolved at run time.
- They are passed to `streamwright` only as `STREAMWRIGHT_SECRET_*` environment variables (via a Kubernetes `Secret` in k8s mode).
- They are never on the command line, in the image, in the run config, or in a log.

See [Security: secrets](architecture.md#security-secrets) for the details.
